# Explore the Solar System

## What I Built

I created an interactive web application that allows users to explore our solar system. The landing page provides an overview of the Sun, planets, moons, and other celestial objects, offering an engaging and educational experience for space enthusiasts of all ages.

## Journey

### Process

1. I started by creating the HTML structure to organize the content about various celestial bodies.
2. I then styled the page using CSS to create a space-themed appearance with a dark background and bright text.
3. JavaScript was used to add interactivity, including:
   - A star field background
   - Animated comets
   - Modal popups for detailed information about each celestial body
   - Smooth scrolling navigation

### What I Learned

- How to create a visually appealing space theme using CSS gradients and animations
- Implementing modals and smooth scrolling navigation using vanilla JavaScript
- Improving accessibility by adding keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes

### Proud Achievements

- The star field and comet animations add a dynamic feel to the page
- The responsive design works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Accessibility features make the site usable for people relying on assistive technologies

### Next Steps

- Add more detailed information and images for each celestial body
- Implement a 3D model of the solar system using WebGL
- Create interactive quizzes to test users' knowledge of the solar system
